Practice Part One
What is HTTP? It is a way of communication between a web browser and a server. It is also a protocol that can be used to fetch resources such as HTML documents. 
What is a URL?unique address of a web page
What is DNS? The conversion of IP address from domain name
What is a query string? a part of the URL or full query that allows to send information using parameters as key-value pairs.
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? The two http verbs used are GET and POST. Get doesn't change the data on the server but POST does.
What is an HTTP request? it is request to retrieve information from the server after TCP channel has been established. 
What is an HTTP response? it is a reponse of information from a server containing the data requested.
What is an HTTP header? Additional information request 
Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
	1. at the video I saw Accept Language which translates the text into specific language request
	2. Date which shows the origin of message
	3. Content-Disposition that opens a file download box
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
	When I type a URL into a browser, the web page will request information via HTTP from the browser. It goes into an established TCP and goes to the server
	to retrieve information that I requested.Once it reaches the server, it will give the information to the TCP channel until it reaches the client.
